        "To search for people given their current title, current company, and location using the Crustdata API, you can utilize the `CURRENT_TITLE`, `CURRENT_COMPANY`, and location-based filters. \n\nThe `CURRENT_TITLE` filter allows you to specify a list of strings for case-insensitive contains matching. For example, `[\"ceo\", \"founder\", \"director\"]` will match profiles with any current job title(s) having any of these strings.\n\nThe `CURRENT_COMPANY` filter also accepts a list of strings, which can be company names, domains, or LinkedIn URLs.\n\nFor location-based filtering, you can use the `COMPANY_HEADQUARTERS` filter, which accepts a list of region values.\n\nHere's an example of how you can construct a filter dictionary for a person search:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"filters\": [\n    {\n      \"field\": \"CURRENT_TITLE\",\n      \"type\": \"in\",\n      \"values\": [\"ceo\", \"founder\", \"director\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"field\": \"CURRENT_COMPANY\",\n      \"type\": \"in\",\n      \"values\": [\"Serve Robotics\", \"serverobotics.com\", \"https://www.linkedin.com/company/serverobotics\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"field\": \"COMPANY_HEADQUARTERS\",\n      \"type\": \"in\",\n      \"values\": [\"United States\", \"Canada\"]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis filter dictionary will match people with current titles containing \"ceo\", \"founder\", or \"director\", working at companies with names, domains, or LinkedIn URLs matching \"Serve Robotics\", \"serverobotics.com\", or \"https://www.linkedin.com/company/serverobotics\", and having company headquarters in the United States or Canada.\n\nPlease note that you should refer to the [Building the Company/People Search Criteria Filter](https://www.notion.so/Building-the-Company-People-Search-Criteria-Filter-116e4a7d95b180528ce4f6c485a76c40?pvs=21) documentation for more information on constructing custom search filters.\n\nAlso, ensure that you validate your API request snippet according to the Crustdata API documentation to avoid any errors. The provided example is based on the available documentation and might require adjustments based on the actual API endpoint and parameters. \n\nIn case of any issues, you can try to adjust the filter dictionary or check the API logs for more information on the error. If you're unsure about any details, please refer to the official Crustdata API documentation for more information. \n\nExample API request snippet:\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  https://`api.crustdata.com`/v1/search \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n        \"filters\": [\n          {\n            \"field\": \"CURRENT_TITLE\",\n            \"type\": \"in\",\n            \"values\": [\"ceo\", \"founder\", \"director\"]\n          },\n          {\n            \"field\": \"CURRENT_COMPANY\",\n            \"type\": \"in\",\n            \"values\": [\"Serve Robotics\", \"serverobotics.com\", \"https://www.linkedin.com/company/serverobotics\"]\n          },\n          {\n            \"field\": \"COMPANY_HEADQUARTERS\",\n            \"type\": \"in\",\n            \"values\": [\"United States\", \"Canada\"]\n          }\n        ]\n      }'\n```\nPlease validate this snippet according to your actual API endpoint and parameters."
